## Paul Beasly
Welcome to my profile page!  I'm a graduate student in Applied Math/Data Science.  My background is in analog IC design and business/marketing. My passion is to discover patterns and relationships in data.


Below are a few of my portfolio highlights.  To learn more, feel free to connect with me, [pbeasly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-beasly-372b888/).

## Computer Vision - Butterfly Classification and Segmentation
The Deep Learning project trains a model to identify the species of a butterfly from an image.  The project also trains a model to distinguish the butterfly from the surrounding background. The project [Butterfly-Computer-Vision](https://github.com/pbeasly/computer-vision-butterflies) uses different model architectures and compares the accuracy performance of different approaches.

## Scientific Computing - Vorticity Streamfunction
The visually pleasing animation is an example of my work studying Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington.  The project [Vorticity-Streamfunction](https://github.com/pbeasly/Vorticity-Streamfunction) simulates the time evolution of the vorticity and stream function equations using python's numpy package.

## Data Visualization - Global Military Spend
The project [military-expenditures](https://github.com/pbeasly/military-expenditures) performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on military expenditures across the globe \(Source: SIPRI Military Database 2023, https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex). The chart displays statistical information on the miliatary spend as a percentage of GDP for different world regions.

## Data Analysis - New York City Schools SAT Results
The project [NYC-SAT-scores](https://github.com/pbeasly/NYC-SAT-scores) explores how different factors influnce the SAT results in NYC city schools.  The chart shows a scatter plot of SAT results vs Advanced Placement (AP) course offerings.
