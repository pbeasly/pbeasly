## Scientific Computing - Vorticity Streamfunction
The visually pleasing animation is an example of my work studying Applied Mathematics at the University of Washington.  The project [Vorticity-Streamfunction](https://github.com/pbeasly/Vorticity-Streamfunction) simulates the time evolution of the vorticity and stream function equations using python's numpy package.

## Data Visualization - Global Military Spend
The project [military-expenditures](https://github.com/pbeasly/military-expenditures) performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on military expenditures across the globe \(Source: SIPRI Military Database 2023, https://www.sipri.org/databases/milex). The chart displays statistical information on the miliatary spend as a percentage of GDP for different world regions.
