- <div align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/pbeasly/Vorticity-Streamfunction/blob/main/Vorticiy-Animation.gif" alt="Alt text" width="100" height="100">
</div>



- and trying some more ideas


<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: space-between;">
    <div>
        <p>Here is some text that will describe the animation and explain how it was simulated and created.  Not sure how large the text will be or how it will look.</p>
    </div>
